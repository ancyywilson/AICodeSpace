🚀 AI Powered Code Playground


An interactive AI-powered code playground built with React + Vite, designed for experimenting with code snippets, UI components, and future AI-driven developer tools in a fast, modern environment.
This project serves as a foundation for building intelligent coding experiences such as AI code suggestions, live previews, component testing, and developer experimentation.

📌 Overview


The AI Powered Code Playground is a lightweight and extensible web application that provides a clean interface for developers to write, test, and explore code. Powered by Vite, it ensures lightning-fast startup and hot module replacement, making development smooth and efficient.
The project is intentionally kept modular so that AI features like code completion, error detection, or chatbot integration can be added in future versions.
